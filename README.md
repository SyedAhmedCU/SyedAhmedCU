-  Hi, I’m @SyedAhmedCU

I am an Full-Stack Developer with a strong technical foundation in building and deploying scalable, high-impact software solutions. My career has evolved from a solid academic background in Mechanical Engineering, earning a Master’s degree from Carleton University to a dynamic software development role, leveraging my skills in cutting-edge technologies.

Most recently, as a Full-Stack Software Developer, I engineered RESTful APIs, optimized database performance, and implemented cloud-based microservices architecture using AWS, which improved system performance and reduced manual processes. I’m passionate about working in fast-paced, cross-functional environments, where collaboration and innovative problem-solving are key to delivering impactful solutions.

Key technologies I’ve worked with include:

#Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Python
#Frameworks & Libraries: Node.js, React, Express.js, .NET 
#Cloud Technologies: AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, CloudWatch), Docker, Serverless
#Databases: MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, MS SQL Server, MySQL
#Markup Languages: HTML, CSS, XAML
#DevOps: CI/CD Pipelines, Docker, GitHub Actions
#Development Tools and Processes: VS Code, Git, Github, Visual Studio, Jira Automation, Slack Automation
#Agile Practices: Scrum, Jira

I’m continuously expanding my skill set by exploring new technologies, and I’m actively looking for my next opportunity to contribute to a talented team and drive high-quality software delivery.

I’m open to relocation across Canada and eager to connect with professionals in the software development space who share a passion for innovation and growth.
